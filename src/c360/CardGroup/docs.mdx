# Card Group

Card groups are used to bunch together cards with a similar theme.

### A card group is made up of:

- A main title
- A collection of 3 cards - each with their own sub-title, description and call to action

### Accessibility

- A card group is identified by `role="list`. Each sub-item (card) is wrapped by `role="listitem"`

### Mobile

- A card group will have 3 cards per a row on desktop and collapse into 1 card per row on mobile.
